# Per-million-token pricing overrides.
#
# Models listed here take priority over litellm's auto-maintained pricing.
# Use this to:
#   - Add pricing for models missing from litellm (e.g. private deployments)
#   - Correct stale or inaccurate litellm entries
#
# Format:
#   "model-key" = { input = <dollars_per_million_input_tokens>, output = <dollars_per_million_output_tokens> }
#
# The model key must match the string passed to Provider(model=...).

[models]
# Examples (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# "azure/my-custom-deploy" = { input = 2.00, output = 8.00 }
# "claude-sonnet-4" = { input = 3.00, output = 15.00 }
