# Explanation

Understanding the design and concepts behind pytest-skill-engineering.

## Guides

- **[Choosing a Test Harness](choosing-a-harness.md)** — `Eval` vs `CopilotEval`: which harness to use and why
- **[Evals](evals.md)** — The core concept: what evals are, how they're compared, winning criteria
- **[Skill Engineering](skill-engineering.md)** — The discipline of designing modular, callable skills (tools, prompts, skills, custom agents) and how to test and iterate them
- **[AI Analysis](ai-analysis.md)** — Why AI analysis is mandatory and what makes reports actionable

For internal architecture and report implementation details, see [Contributing](../contributing/index.md).
