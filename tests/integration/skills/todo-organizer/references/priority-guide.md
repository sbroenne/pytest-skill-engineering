# Task Priority Guidelines

## Priority Levels

### HIGH Priority
Assign high priority when ANY of these apply:
- Due today or overdue
- Blocking other people's work
- Has a hard deadline within 24 hours
- Financial consequences for delay
- Keywords: "urgent", "ASAP", "critical", "deadline today"

### NORMAL Priority (Default)
Use for most tasks that:
- Are due within 1-7 days
- Are important but not urgent
- Can be scheduled flexibly
- Are standalone tasks

### LOW Priority
Assign low priority when:
- No specific deadline
- "Nice to have" items
- Can be deferred indefinitely
- Keywords: "someday", "maybe", "when I have time"

## List Assignment Rules

| Task Type | Suggested List | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Buy groceries | shopping | normal |
| Meeting prep | work | based on meeting date |
| Call mom | personal | normal |
| Learn guitar | someday | low |
| Pay bills | personal | high (if due soon) |
| Review PR | work | high (blocking others) |
| Clean garage | personal | low |
| Submit report | work | based on deadline |

## Time-Based Priority Escalation

- **Due today**: Always HIGH
- **Due tomorrow**: HIGH if complex task
- **Due this week**: NORMAL
- **Due next week**: NORMAL, can be LOW if simple
- **No due date**: LOW (unless inherently urgent)

## Context Keywords to Watch

### Elevate to HIGH:
- "boss asked", "client needs", "deadline"
- "before [meeting/event]", "blocking"
- "urgent", "critical", "emergency"

### Keep at LOW:
- "someday", "eventually", "when possible"
- "nice to have", "would be cool"
- "no rush", "whenever"
