# Slicers

PivotTable slicers filter their connected PivotTables. Table slicers filter one
Excel Table. Filtering source-table rows does not automatically filter a
separate PivotTable cache. Use the matching creation, listing, selection, and
deletion actions for each type.

## Required creation inputs

Every creation needs a session, a unique slicer name, a destination worksheet, and
a cell position for its top-left corner. Names and positions are **not**
generated automatically.

PivotTable slicers additionally need the PivotTable name and field name.
Table slicers need the Table name and column name. Inspect the relevant slicer
list and source fields before creating one. The destination sheet must exist.

These examples assume the session, `SalesPivot`, `SalesData`, and `Analysis` sheet
already exist. Check each result before proceeding.

```text
slicer(action: 'create-slicer', session_id: sessionId, pivot_table_name: 'SalesPivot', field_name: 'Region', slicer_name: 'RegionSlicer', destination_sheet: 'Analysis', position: 'E2')
slicer(action: 'set-slicer-selection', session_id: sessionId, slicer_name: 'RegionSlicer', selected_items: '["North"]')
slicer(action: 'create-table-slicer', session_id: sessionId, table_name: 'SalesData', column_name: 'Product', slicer_name: 'ProductSlicer', destination_sheet: 'Analysis', position: 'H2')
slicer(action: 'set-table-slicer-selection', session_id: sessionId, slicer_name: 'ProductSlicer', selected_items: '["Laptop"]')
```


## Selection and verification

Selections are JSON-array **text**, such as `'["North","South"]'`, not a native
array argument in MCP. `'[]'` clears the filter. The default replaces the
selection; disabling clear-first adds to it. The implementation compares names
case-insensitively, but use the actual item names returned by Excel.

Unmatched values are not individually rejected, and Excel may retain a selection
when asked to deselect every item. Never infer success from the requested values:
read the slicer selection and the filtered Table rows or PivotTable data.
Check combined filters together. Deleting a slicer is not the same operation as
clearing its filter; explicitly clear first if that is the intended result.

Read [PivotTable guidance](pivottable.md) for source refresh and field setup.
