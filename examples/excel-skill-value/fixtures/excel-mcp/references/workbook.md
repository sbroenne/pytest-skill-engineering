# Workbook Lifecycle

Use workbook operations for metadata, file variants, publishing, and external
links. Session lifecycle is separate.

```text
workbook(action: 'get-info', session_id: sessionId)
workbook(action: 'list-external-links', session_id: sessionId)
```


## Metadata and document properties

- `get-info` returns the active workbook name, path, Excel file format, saved/read-only state, and password/write-reservation flags.
- `list-document-properties` can include built-in properties, custom properties, or both.
- `get-document-property` and `set-document-property` default to custom properties.
  Use `scope: 'built-in'` (MCP) / `--scope built-in` (CLI) for a built-in property.
- Built-in properties can be read and updated but not deleted.
- Missing custom properties are created as string properties by `set-document-property`; `delete-document-property` removes custom properties only.

## Save and publish

- `save-as` supports `auto`, `xlsx`, `xlsm`, `xlsb`, and `xls`. The file extension must match the selected format, and the active session follows the new path.
- `save-copy-as` preserves the current format and leaves the active workbook/session unchanged. Its target extension must match the active workbook.
- `export-fixed-format` publishes PDF or XPS. Keep `open_after_publish: false`
  (MCP) / `--open-after-publish false` (CLI), the default, for unattended workflows.
- Output directories must already exist. Replacing an existing output file
  requires `overwrite: true` (MCP) / `--overwrite true` (CLI) and authorization for that replacement.

Changing formats can remove unsupported workbook features. In particular, saving a macro-enabled workbook as `.xlsx` removes VBA content after Excel's format conversion.

## External Excel links

1. Call `list-external-links` and use the exact returned `source`.
2. Call `update-external-link` to refresh one source.
3. Call `break-external-link` only with explicit user intent: it permanently replaces linked formulas with their current values.

Breaking a link has no tool-level undo. Until saved, an authorized close without
saving can discard the change, but it also discards earlier unsaved work.

Printing and print preview are not exposed. Printing can send output to a physical default printer, and preview is modal and can block unattended Excel sessions.
