# Calculation Mode

`calculation_mode` controls automatic, manual, and semi-automatic recalculation
(automatic except what-if data tables, not worksheet Tables). All actions
require `session_id`.

## Calculation after writes

Range value/formula writes temporarily suppress calculation when appropriate,
then attempt to restore the prior mode. They do not unconditionally calculate
after every write:

Restoration can fail without failing the write, leaving Excel in manual mode.
Use `calculation_mode(action: 'get-mode', session_id: id)` when
subsequent work depends on the mode.

| Mode | Dependent formulas after a write |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Automatic | Excel normally recalculates when the original mode is restored. |
| Manual | The mode stays manual; explicitly calculate before relying on dependent results. |
| Semi-automatic | After restoration, ordinary formulas recalculate, but what-if data tables require explicit calculation. |

A successful write does not guarantee that asynchronous refreshes or Python
calculations have finished. Use the owning operation's completion checks and
read back the calculated values needed for the task.

Use manual mode for bulk writes when repeated recalculation is costly. There is
no universal cell-count threshold: one rectangular write is already batched.
Reading formula text does not require changing the mode. Keep calculation
available when intermediate formula results are needed.

## Preserve the Workbook's Mode

1. Call `get-mode` and remember the returned `mode`.
2. Call `set-mode` with `mode: 'manual'`.
3. Write the requested values/formulas in rectangular blocks.
4. Call `calculate` with the appropriate scope.
5. Restore the prior mode, not necessarily `automatic`.

Treat restoration like a `finally` block: attempt it after success or failure.
If cancellation or a timeout removed the session, inspect `file list` first and
report that restoration could not be completed. Do not blindly reopen or repeat
writes; cancellation is not undo.

```text
previous = calculation_mode(action: 'get-mode', session_id: id).mode
try:
    calculation_mode(action: 'set-mode', session_id: id, mode: 'manual')
    range(action: 'set-values', session_id: id, sheet_name: 'Sales',
          range_address: 'A1:B2', values: [['Name', 'Amount'], ['Salary', 5000]])
    calculation_mode(action: 'calculate', session_id: id, scope: 'workbook')
finally:
    calculation_mode(action: 'set-mode', session_id: id, mode: previous)
```

The example is workflow notation, not executable code. Check each result before
continuing and surface both the original failure and any restoration failure.

## Actions

| Action | Purpose | Additional inputs |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `get-mode` | Read current mode and calculation state | None |
| `set-mode` | Change the mode | `mode`: `automatic`, `manual`, or `semi-automatic` |
| `calculate` | Recalculate formulas | `scope`: `workbook`, `sheet`, or `range` |

Sheet scope requires `sheet_name`. Range scope also requires `range_address`.
Choose workbook scope when dependencies cross sheets; inspect calculated values
when they are part of the requested result.
