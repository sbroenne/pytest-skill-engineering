# Charts

Chart lifecycle operations create, list, read, move, fit, and delete charts.
Chart-configuration operations manage series, titles, axes, labels, styles, and
trendlines. Reuse the returned chart name rather than assuming Excel's default.

## Choose the source before creating

Use the existing data directly when it already has useful categories and the
requested measures. Do not require a helper range, another Table, or extra
charts. Inspect the headers and a few rows first: numeric IDs, dates, percentages,
and amounts are not interchangeable series. A revenue comparison needs product
labels and revenue, not product IDs or every numeric column.

Choose a bounded range including its headers and intended data rows. Exclude
notes and grand totals that would duplicate the detail values. Keep categories
and values aligned, with the same row count. When a suitable Excel Table already
contains the requested fields, use Table-based creation to retain its source
behavior; check the plotted rows again after appending data. A fixed helper range
does not automatically grow with the original Table.

For a chart that must follow PivotTable fields and filters, use a live PivotChart,
not a regular chart of the displayed PivotTable cells. Change its series through
the [PivotTable fields](pivottable.md), not regular-chart series operations.

## Create and position

Choose the source deliberately: a range, an Excel Table, or a PivotTable. The
PivotTable action verifies a live PivotChart link; it fails rather than returning
a static chart if Excel cannot establish it.

For monthly labels in A1:A6 and numeric series in B1:C6 on `Sheet1`:

```text
chart(action: 'create-from-range', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Sheet1', source_range_address: 'A1:C6', chart_type: 'ColumnClustered', chart_name: 'MonthlySales', target_range: 'A8:H22')
chart_config(action: 'set-title', session_id: sessionId, chart_name: 'MonthlySales', title: 'Monthly sales')
chart(action: 'read', session_id: sessionId, chart_name: 'MonthlySales')
```


Check each result. Prefer a target cell range for an exact placement. Omit both
target range and coordinates to auto-place below used cells and existing charts
with padding. Manual coordinates use points (72 per inch); row and column sizes
vary, so do not assume a fixed conversion from cells.

Creation, move, and fit operations warn about overlapping data/charts. An
`OVERLAP WARNING` can accompany success: fix the placement and check again.
Use a [screenshot](screenshot.md) when appearance matters and an interactive
desktop is available; otherwise inspect bounds and state the visual limitation.

## Short labels without losing detail

Use this only when the existing labels are too long. Keep full descriptions and
source values intact. Put a small chart helper in a checked empty area, with
formulas linking its labels and amounts to the source rather than hardcoding a
second set of amounts. Include an identifier or another distinguishing part
when truncating text would produce duplicate labels. Grouping categories changes
the calculation, not just the label: state the grouping rule and summarize all
matching rows instead of keeping only one.

For existing `Details!A1:C4` containing `Product ID`, `Description`, and
`Revenue`, use empty `F1:G4` on the same sheet. The ID keeps shortened labels
distinct; the original description remains in column B:

```text
range(action: 'set-values', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Details', range_address: 'F1:G1', values: [['Product','Revenue']])
range(action: 'set-formulas', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Details', range_address: 'F2:G4', formulas: [['=A2&" - "&LEFT(B2,18)','=C2'],['=A3&" - "&LEFT(B3,18)','=C3'],['=A4&" - "&LEFT(B4,18)','=C4']])
calculation_mode(action: 'calculate', session_id: sessionId, scope: 'Sheet', sheet_name: 'Details')
range(action: 'get-formulas', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Details', range_address: 'F2:G4')
range(action: 'get-values', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Details', range_address: 'F1:G4')
chart(action: 'create-from-range', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Details', source_range_address: 'F1:G4', chart_type: 'BarClustered', chart_name: 'ProductRevenue')
```


Check each result before continuing, including label uniqueness and unchanged
source amounts. These formulas follow fixed source rows: after a sort or source
growth, recheck the mapping and extend the helper and chart source as needed.
Do not silently replace an existing growing Table source with this fixed range.

## Readable periods in chronological order

Displaying a timestamp as a month does not aggregate the transactions. Use a
period summary when the requested trend needs monthly, quarterly, or yearly
values. Keep real dates as the period keys, display month/quarter/year labels,
and order by those dates rather than alphabetically by label. Keep the year:
December 2025 and January 2026 are consecutive periods, not a month-name sort.
State whether values are sums, counts, averages, or another measure; do not
average percentages without considering their denominators.

For an existing `Transactions` Table with native Excel `Date` values and numeric
`Revenue`, use an empty `Summary!A1:B3`. These two rows show monthly sums, including
timestamps on the last day and excluding the next month's first day:

```text
range(action: 'set-values', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', range_address: 'A1:B3', values: [['Month','Revenue'],['2025-12-01',null],['2026-01-01',null]])
range(action: 'set-formulas', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', range_address: 'B2:B3', formulas: [['=SUMIFS(Transactions[Revenue],Transactions[Date],">="&A2,Transactions[Date],"<"&EDATE(A2,1))'],['=SUMIFS(Transactions[Revenue],Transactions[Date],">="&A3,Transactions[Date],"<"&EDATE(A3,1))']])
range(action: 'set-number-format', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', range_address: 'A2:A3', format_code: 'mmm yyyy')
calculation_mode(action: 'calculate', session_id: sessionId, scope: 'Sheet', sheet_name: 'Summary')
range(action: 'get-values', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', range_address: 'A1:B3')
chart(action: 'create-from-range', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', source_range_address: 'A1:B3', chart_type: 'Line', chart_name: 'MonthlyRevenue')
```


Reconcile representative monthly totals with the underlying transactions. For
quarters or years, use the actual period start and the next quarter/year start
as the boundaries. Include missing periods where the trend requires them;
`SUMIFS` returns zero with no matching rows, which is appropriate only when
absence means no activity, not unknown or incomplete data. Do not disguise
missing data as zero; choose the chart's blank-cell behavior deliberately.

For an interactive trend, summarize in the existing regular PivotTable instead.
For example, `RevenuePivot` already has native-date `Date` in Rows and Sum of
`Revenue` in Values. Month grouping also creates a year hierarchy:

```text
pivottable_field(action: 'group-by-date', session_id: sessionId, pivot_table_name: 'RevenuePivot', field_name: 'Date', interval: 'Months')
pivottable_field(action: 'list-fields', session_id: sessionId, pivot_table_name: 'RevenuePivot')
pivottable(action: 'refresh', session_id: sessionId, pivot_table_name: 'RevenuePivot')
pivottable_calc(action: 'get-data', session_id: sessionId, pivot_table_name: 'RevenuePivot')
chart(action: 'create-from-pivottable', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Summary', pivot_table_name: 'RevenuePivot', chart_type: 'Line', chart_name: 'InteractiveRevenue')
```


Inspect the generated fields rather than assuming their localized names. Check
the year/month order and totals before creating the chart; retain both year and
period distinctions. Date grouping requires valid dates without blank/error
items and is not supported for Data Model PivotTables. For those, use period
columns in the source/model and follow [PivotTable guidance](pivottable.md).

## Make units explicit

Choose display formats from the stored values, not from the column name alone.
Use an axis title or chart title to identify the currency and any scale.
Supply US format codes; Excel translates them for the user's locale, as with
[range number formats](range.md#number-formats-and-layout).
Axis formatting preserves explicit currency symbols and date/time meanings;
read-back returns US codes, not the localized COM codes.

| Stored meaning | Value-axis format | Important check |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| USD amounts | `$#,##0` | Do not assume every currency is USD |
| Fractional share, such as 0.35 | `0%` | Shows 35%; a stored 35 would show 3500% |
| Counts | `#,##0` | Do not relabel a monetary sum as a count |
| Unscaled USD amounts shown in thousands | `#,##0,` | 125000 displays as 125; title says USD thousands |
| Unscaled amounts shown in millions | `0.0,,` | Title identifies both unit and millions |

For the `MonthlyRevenue` chart above, keep the underlying amounts unchanged and
scale only its value-axis display:

```text
chart_config(action: 'set-axis-title', session_id: sessionId, chart_name: 'MonthlyRevenue', axis: 'Value', title: 'Revenue (USD thousands)')
chart_config(action: 'set-axis-number-format', session_id: sessionId, chart_name: 'MonthlyRevenue', axis: 'Value', number_format: '#,##0,')
chart_config(action: 'get-axis-number-format', session_id: sessionId, chart_name: 'MonthlyRevenue', axis: 'Value')
```


Do not both divide helper values by 1000 and apply a thousands-scaling format.
If the source already stores thousands, use an ordinary numeric format and
label it accordingly. For whole-number percentages such as 35, use a clearly
identified formula-linked conversion to 0.35 if a percentage axis is needed;
do not change the original data silently.

Data-label options choose what to show, not a custom label number format.
Percentage labels on pie/doughnut charts mean each slice's share of the plotted
total; they are not a general percentage formatter for line/column charts.
For value labels, check their displayed units separately from the axis format;
an axis scaled to thousands does not establish that labels use the same scale.

## Configuration

- Series indices are 1-based. Adding a series requires a values range; supply its
  category range when the axis labels are not implicit.
- Replacing the source range can change all series. Verify names, values, and
  categories afterward.
- Set per-series chart types for regular combo charts. Use plot options for
  row/column orientation, blanks, and whether hidden cells are plotted.
- Use Category and Value for primary axis titles. Use US number formats for
  currency/percentage tick labels; do not assume an axis format also formats
  data labels.
- Built-in chart styles are 1-48. Area formatting controls chart/plot backgrounds;
  series formatting controls fills, lines, and markers.
- Placement 1 moves and sizes with cells, 2 moves only, 3 is free floating.
- Trendlines include Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Polynomial, Power, and
  MovingAverage. Polynomial order is 2-6; moving-average period is at least 2.
  Respect Excel's data/domain requirements for the selected fit.

For multiple charts, use explicit non-overlapping cell ranges with consistent
sizes and spacing. Auto-placement is suitable for a vertical stack. Read the
saved chart's actual geometry and series; a successful creation or a prose
description alone does not establish a correct chart.

## Check data, not just appearance

Read the chart after creation or a source change. Check its series names/count
and available source information, then read the referenced cells and helper
formulas or PivotTable totals. Compare representative amounts with the original
rows; check category/value alignment, period order, and the treatment of totals,
hidden rows, blanks, and errors.

For regular charts, `sourceRange` currently contains the first series' `SERIES`
formula, not a complete source rectangle. `valuesRange` and `categoryRange` may
contain an array type name rather than cell addresses or plotted values.
Do not treat those strings as proof of every series' bindings or values.
PivotCharts instead report `isPivotChart` and `linkedPivotTable`; verify that
link and the actual PivotTable fields, filters, and data.

Keep checks and changes within the request. Changing a title or unit display
does not authorize replacing the source, rebuilding unrelated data, restyling
the workbook, adding charts, or repairing unrelated pre-existing errors.
