  Workflow and recovery guidance for Excel MCP automation on Windows. Use when handling
  Power Query loading failures, Data Model/DAX and PivotTable sequencing,
  preserving existing workbooks, or requested report formatting.
  Supports Excel workbooks, xlsx, xlsm, Tables, ranges, charts, and dashboards.
compatibility: Requires Windows and Microsoft Excel 2016 or later. Node.js 18+ is required when running through npx. The VS Code extension bundles its server and does not require a separate Node.js or .NET installation.

# Excel MCP workflow guidance

Provides 326 Excel operations. Tool schemas describe the available actions and
parameters; server instructions already cover sessions, saving, permissions,
visibility, and call ordering. Use those directly, not a second command catalog.

Read only the reference needed for an unresolved decision or recovery. Do not
read every guide, or the index before each task. Examples use `sessionId` as a
local variable; MCP inputs use the advertised snake_case names.

## Choose a workflow

| Decision | Reference |
|----------|-----------|
| A query failed during loading; deciding update versus recreate | [Power Query recovery](./references/powerquery.md#recovering-a-failed-create) |
| Stored transformations versus measures; model refresh and relationships | [Data Model](./references/datamodel.md) |
| Ordinary calculated fields versus per-row calculations | [PivotTables](./references/pivottable.md) |
| Chart sources, labels, periods, units, or live PivotCharts | [Charts](./references/chart.md#choose-the-source-before-creating) |
| Existing formulas, identifiers, dates, or merged cells must survive edits | [Ranges](./references/range.md) |
| Changing an existing Table or producing worksheet results from DAX | [Tables](./references/table.md) |
| The user requests formatting, or a new user-facing report needs presentation | [Optional report formatting](./references/report-formatting.md) |
| An unfamiliar failure or permission boundary | [Recovery and permission](./references/behavioral-rules.md#intent-and-permission) |
| Another topic | [Reference index](./references/index.md) |

## Check the requested result

Verify affected values/formulas or object state, not just a successful creation
call. Query definitions do not prove loaded data is current; model queries do
not refresh worksheet sources. A chart of PivotTable cells is not a live
PivotChart. Use the corresponding guide when these distinctions matter.

Range content writes/copies check for existing content by default. When the
request authorizes replacement, supply `overwrite_policy: 'allow'`; do not ask
redundant confirmation or automatically retry a rejected write with `allow`.
See [protected writes](./references/range.md#protected-writes-and-copies).

Read back the relevant result once it is ready. Avoid repeated discovery without
a state change and unrelated refresh, styling, or screenshots. Report partial
work honestly. The formatting guide is optional, not a requirement to restyle
existing templates, raw exports, or data-only tasks.
